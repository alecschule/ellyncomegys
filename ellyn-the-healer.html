                  <h2>About Ellyn the Healer</h2>
                  <p>Ellyn has been a Registered Nurse for 20+ years and has been able to intertwine her nursing experience and her interest in healing herself and others into her healing business.  Her passion is health and happiness for everyone.  She is healthy and fit, eats healthy food, works with a personal trainer and goes on 15-minute adventures with her husband, John.</p>
                  <p>Six years ago, she became interested in conscious connected breathing and began the process of removing old stored memories in muscles, releasing old experiences, and behavior patterns that no longer worked.  Since that time Ellyn has been able to develop new behavior patterns and connect her heart to her head.  She is happier and healthier and has been able to deepen her relationship with herself and others.  Just recently she completed the six-month healing intensive taking her to the master’s level.  She is now a Master Healer and is accepting clients on a regular basis.</p>
                  <p>Ellyn has a Master’s Degree in counseling, completed the 2-year Gestalt training, certified as an art therapist and a life coach.  She also, has completed the first level of Reiki, and has received the 70-hour certification to be a conscious connected healer.</p>
